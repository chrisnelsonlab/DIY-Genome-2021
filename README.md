# DIY-Genome-2021
## Overview
Today we will examine the topic of CRISPR. It is our hope that you by going through the day, you will:
* Learn what CRISPR can do
* Understand where CRISPR came from
* Gain the confidence to perform a CRISPR edit yourself
* Discuss what is an ethical and unethical use of CRISPR

We will be available to answer questions and discuss throughout the day. We wish this could be in person so you could do a gene edit of your own!
